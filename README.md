### Description
This project was fun and interesting. I did this out of my own interest and also to learn how to handle image data with a deep learning model.
Through doing this project, it taught me:
* The process of a TensorFlow workflow
* How to preprocess images before fitting it to a neural network model
* Turning data into batches
* Creating early stopping callbacks to save time on experimentation
* Utilizing TensorBoard logs to evaluate our model

**Note:** This notebook was created and trained in Google Colab, I wanted to do it on my local machine, but it made more sense to use Google Colab since I was training this model on 10,000+ images and Colab has free GPU access through Google's servers. Because of this however, the easiest way to replicate running this notebook on another machine would be to use Google colab. Here are some loosly structured steps to help you get it running
* Upload my .ipynb file to your google drive
* Go to colab.research.google.com
* Sign into your google account through Colab
* Open the file
